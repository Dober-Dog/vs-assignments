            <h1>The New York Yankees</h1>
            <p>The New York Yankees, one of Major League Baseball's most storied franchises, have a rich history dating back to their founding in 1901. Originally known as the Baltimore Orioles, the team moved to New York in 1903 and was renamed the New York Highlanders. In 1913, the team officially became the New York Yankees.</p>
            <p>The Yankees' rise to prominence began in the 1920s with the acquisition of Babe Ruth from the Boston Red Sox, which heralded the start of the team's first golden era. Ruth, alongside stars like Lou Gehrig, led the Yankees to their first World Series title in 1923, and they continued to dominate throughout the decade, winning additional championships in 1927 and 1928.</p>
            <p>The team's success persisted through the 1930s and 1940s, with notable players like Joe DiMaggio and the legendary manager Joe McCarthy. The Yankees won multiple World Series titles during this period, including four consecutive championships from 1936 to 1939.</p>
            <p>The 1950s saw another wave of success with stars like Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, and Whitey Ford. The Yankees won six World Series titles during this decade. The 1960s brought continued success, including titles in 1961 and 1962, but the team faced a decline towards the latter part of the decade and into the 1970s.</p>
            <p>The late 1970s marked a resurgence under owner George Steinbrenner and manager Billy Martin, with the Yankees capturing back-to-back championships in 1977 and 1978, led by players such as Reggie Jackson and Thurman Munson.</p>
            <p>After a period of inconsistency in the 1980s, the Yankees experienced a revival in the mid-1990s under manager Joe Torre. This era, featuring stars like Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, and Bernie Williams, brought the Yankees four World Series titles in five years (1996, 1998, 1999, and 2000). They added another championship in 2009, led by many of the same core players and new additions like Alex Rodriguez.</p>
            <p>Throughout their history, the Yankees have been known for their iconic pinstripe uniforms and have played home games at Yankee Stadium, with the original ballpark opening in 1923 and the new stadium debuting in 2009.</p>
            <p>The New York Yankees remain one of the most successful and recognizable franchises in sports, boasting 27 World Series titles and 40 American League pennants, the most in MLB history. Their legacy is marked by a tradition of excellence, a roster of legendary players, and a devoted fan base.</p>
